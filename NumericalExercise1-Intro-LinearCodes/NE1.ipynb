    "\n",
    "1. **Generator Matrices and Parity-Check Matrices:**  You will write a function that takes one to the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Weight Enumerators:**  You will compute the weight enumerator for various codes.  You will see that the weight enumerator of a random linear code tends to look like a binomial distribution.  You will also see that random codes usually have poor minimum Hamming distance compared with some good constructions.\n",

    "3. **Hamming Codes:**  You will generalize the (7,4) binary Hamming code, and build decoders for error-correction and for erasure correction.\n",

    "## Converting between Generator and Parity-Check Matrices ##\n",
    "\n",
    "Some useful facts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If $G_{sys}= [I_k \\mid P] $ is a $k \\times n$ generator matrix in systematic form, then $H_{sys} = [ -P^{\\intercal} \\mid I_{n-k} ]$ is a corresponding parity-check matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. An $n \\times n$ permutation matrix $Q$ is a matrix with entries from $\\{ 0, 1 \\}$ having exactly one nonzero entry in each row and column.  If $Q$ is a permutation matrix, then $Q Q^{\\intercal} = Q^{\\intercal} Q = I_n$.  If $G$ is a $k \\times n$ matrix, then the product $GQ$ has the same columns as $G$, except in a permuted order, i.e., multiplication on the right by $Q$ performs a column permutation.  For example, $$ \\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc}a & b & c \\\\ d & e & f \\end{array} \\right] \\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\end{array} \\right] = \\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc} a & c & b \\\\ d & f & e \\end{array} \\right] .$$  Note that permutation matrices are well defined over any field.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Let $F$ be any field.  Suppose $G \\in F^{k \\times n}$ and  $H \\in F^{(n-k) \\times n}$ are matrices, and $Q \\in F^{n \\times n}$ is a permutation matrix.   Then $$GQ (HQ)^\\intercal = G Q Q^{\\intercal} H^{\\intercal} = GH^{\\intercal}.$$   Thus, in particular, if $G H^{\\intercal} = 0$, then $(GQ)(HQ)^{\\intercal} = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Now let $G$ be a matrix in reduced row echelon form.  For some permutation matrix $Q$, we can write $G_{sys} = GQ$ (i.e., by permuting columns, we can convert from rref to systematic form).  Let $H_{sys}$ satisfy\n",
    "$G_{sys}H_{sys}^{\\intercal} = 0$.  By writing $H_{sys} = HQ$, we also have $GH^{\\intercal}=0$.  Thus we can recover $H$ from $H_{sys}$ by computing $$H = H_{sys} Q^{\\intercal}.$$  In other words, in principle we can compute $H$ from $G$ by first reducing $G$ to rref, permuting columns (if needed) to convert $G$ to systematic form $G_{sys}$, computing $H_{sys}$, and then performing the inverse permutation on columns to recover $H$ from $H_{sys}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. To avoid a lot of unnecessary data movement caused by permuting columns, observe that in going from $G_{sys}$ to $H_{sys}$ the columns corresponding to $I_k$ are replaced with the columns of $-P^{\\intercal}$, while the columns corresponding to $P$ are replaced with the columns of $I_{n-k}$.  Thus, rather than moving columns around, we can simply work in-place, provided that we know which columns of $G$ correspond to $I_k$ and which columns of $G$ correspond to $P$.  For example, suppose $G$ has the following rref:  $$ G = \\left[ \\begin{array}{ccccc} 1 & a & 0 & 0 & b \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & c \\\\ \\underbrace{0}_u & \\underbrace{0}_p & \\underbrace{0}_u & \\underbrace{1}_u & \\underbrace{d}_p \\end{array} \\right].$$  The columns corresponding to $I_k$ are labelled with $u$ and the columns corresponding to $P$ are labelled with $p$.  We can then compute a parity-check matrix $H$ directly as $$ H = \\left[ \\begin{array}{ccccc} -a & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ -b & 0 & -c & -d & 1 \\end{array}\\right],$$ where the columns of $-P^{\\intercal}$ are placed (in order) in the $u$ columns and the columns of $I_{n-k}$ are placed (in order) in the $p$ columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The function ```rref!``` provided by ```Galois2``` mutates a matrix to reduced row echelon form.  The function ```rref``` (without the ```!```) returns the reduced row echelon form of a matrix without mutating its argument.\n",
    "2. Julia's ```view``` capability can be used to read from and write to selected submatrices of a matrix. Run the following cells and observe the output.\n",
    "3. Julia's ```findfirst``` function can be used to find the index of the pivot element in the ```i```th row of a matrix ```G``` as follows: ```findfirst(x->x!=GF2(0),G[i,:])```;  this expression produces ```nothing``` in case the row is all-zero."

Let `c` be an integer column vector of length $n = 2^m-1$ with entries from the set $\\{-1, 0, 1\\}$ such that at most two of its entries are $-1$. Each $-1$ represents an erasure. Write a function `Erasure_DEC_Hamming(c::Array{Int64,1},H::Array{GF2,2})` that takes an input column vector $c$ which is equal to a Hamming codeword $v$ in all positions, except possibly for a maximum of 2 erasure positions and returns $v$.\n",
