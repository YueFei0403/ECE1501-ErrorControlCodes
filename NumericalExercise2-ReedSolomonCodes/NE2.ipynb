    "1. **Reed&ndash;Solomon Codes and Berlekamp&ndash;Welch Decoder:**  You will implement basic encoding and decoding methods for Reed&ndash;Solomon Codes as polynomial codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Extended Euclidean Algorithm:**  You will implement the generalized Euclidean algorithm and, as an application, you will find the multiplicative inverse of nonzero elements in large finite fields.\n",

    "3. **Generalized Reed&ndash;Solomon Codes:**  You will learn about Generalized Reed&ndash;Solomon Codes and implement an efficient decoder for them.\n",

    "# 0.  Polynomials\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $R$ be any ring, and let $x$ be an **indeterminate** (a **variable**).  A **polynomial** is a formal expression of the form $$a(x) = a_0 x^0 + a_1 x^1 + \\cdots + a_n x^n = \\sum_{i=0}^n a_i x^i,$$ where $n$ is any natural number.  Here $a_0$, $a_1$, $\\ldots$, $a_n$ are elements of $R$, called the **coefficients** of $a(x)$.  Each $a_i x^i$ is called a **term** of $a(x)$.  The set of all polynomials in $x$ with coefficients from $R$ is denoted as $R[x]$.  A term of the form $1 \\cdot x^i$ is usually written as $x^i$ and terms with zero coefficient are often omitted.  Likewise the terms $a_0 x^0$ and $a_1 x^1$ are written as $a_0$ and $a_1 x$, respectively. Thus $1 + 2x + x^3$ corresponds to the formal expression $1x^0 + 2x^1 + 0 x^2 + 1 x^3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polynomials can be added by adding the coefficients of like terms (where missing terms are treated as having zero coefficient).  The **zero polynomial**, i.e., the polynomial all of whose coefficients are zero, serves as the additive identity.  Polynomials can be multiplied by assuming that the distributive law holds, simplifying terms of the form $(a_i x^i)\\cdot (b_j x^j)$ to $a_i b_j x^{i+j}$.  The polynomial $1 = 1x^0$ serves as the multiplicative identity.  Under these operations, $R[x]$ itself forms a ring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $R[x]$ is itself a ring, it is possible to form a ring $(R[x])[y]$ of polynomials in indeterminate $y$ having elements of $R[x]$ as coefficients.  One might also consider the ring $(R[y])[x]$ of polynomials in\n",
    "interminate $x$ have elements of $R[y]$ as coefficients.  There is an obvious correspondence between these rings, either one of which is usually denoted as $R[x,y]$.  The elements of $R[x,y]$ are referred to as **bivariate** polynomials (to distinguish them from the **univariate** polynomials of $R[x]$).  One can extend this idea in the obvious way to form the **trivariate** ring $R[x,y,z]$, or, for any positive integer $m$, to form the **multivariate** ring $R[x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_m]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The **degree** of $a(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + \\cdots + a_n x^n \\in R[x]$, denoted as $\\deg(a)$, is the largest index $i$ for which $a_i\\neq 0$.  This definition does not work for the zero polynomial (since no such index exists), thus by convention the degree of the zero polynomial is defined to be $-\\infty$.  Under this convention, provided that $R$ is an integral domain, we have\n",
    "$$\\deg(pq) = \\deg(p) + \\deg(q)$$ for all polynomials $p(x), q(x)  \\in R[x]$.  (Caution:  addition of degrees doesn't generally hold in $R[x]$ when $R$ is a ring having zero divisors!)   A degree $d$ polynomial $a(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + \\cdots + a_d x^d \\in R[x]$ is said to be **monic** if $a_d = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In $R[x,y]$ we can view a bivariate polynomial as an element of $(R[y])[x]$ and assign it a degree (called\n",
    "its $x$-degree).  Alternatively we can view it as an element of $(R[x])[y]$ and assign it a $y$-degree.  For example, consider $a(x,y) = a_0 + 2x + y + 3xy + xy^2$.  This polynomial can be written as $(a_0 + y) + (2 + 3y + y^2 )x \\in (R[y])[x]$, from which we see that it has $x$-degree equal to one.  Alternatively, $a(x)$ can be written as $(a_0 + 2x) + (1 + 3x)y + (x)y^2 \\in (R[x])[y]$, from which we see that it has $y$-degree equal to two.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this numerical exercise, we will focus on $\\mathbb{F}_q[x]$, i.e.,\n",
    "on univariate polynomials with coefficients from the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. In the following, when we refer to a polynomial, we mean a univariate polynomial, unless clearly stated otherwise.  (Bivariate polynomials will appear in the context of the Berlekamp&ndash;Welch decoding procedure.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Associated with a polynomial $p(x)\\in\\mathbb{F}_q[x]$ is a function defined by evaluation: $$\\hat{p}:\\mathbb{F}_q\\to \\mathbb{F}_q$$ $$\\alpha\\mapsto p(\\alpha).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, we use $p$ instead of $\\hat{p}$ when talking about the function obtained by evaluation of the polynomial $p(x)$. This is an abuse of notation as these are essentially different objects. For example, consider the polynomials $p_1(x), p_2(x)\\in\\mathbb{F}_2[x]$ defined by $p_1(x) = x$ and $p_2(x) = x^2$. These are two distinct polynomials while the functions $\\hat{p}_1$ and $\\hat{p}_2$ are the same! If the evaluation of a polynomial $p(x)$ at a point $\\alpha$ is zero, then $\\alpha$ is called a **root** or **zero** of $p(x)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In software, a polynomial of degree $d$ can be represented with a vector of length $d+1$. In particular, there is a `Polynomials` package in julia that uses this form of representation and allows us to perform basic polynomial operations. Run the following cell to load the `Galois2` module and install (if needed) and load the `Polynomials` package."

At each stage of the algorithm, we have a remainder $r(x)$ which is expressed as a linear combination $a(x) x^{d-1} + b(x) s(x)$.  Reducing modulo $x^{d-1}$ we see that $r(x) = b(x)s(x) \\bmod x^{d-1}$ and thus $r(x)$ is a candidate for $\\Gamma(x)$ and $b(x)$ is a candidate for $\\Lambda(x)$.  It can be proved that indeed $r(x) = \\Gamma(x)$ and $b(x) = \\Lambda(x)$ on the iteration of the EEA when the condition $\\deg(r(x)) < t$ is first satisfied.

    "cyclic code $C$ is called the **design distance** of $C$. The actual minimum distance of $C$ is at least as large as the design distance. Thus, if we wish to design a $t$-error correcting code, we choose $g(x)$ so that it has $2t$ consecutive zeros, i.e., design distance $2t + 1$. This is the main idea in development of Bose&ndash;Chaudhuri&ndash;Hocquenghem (BCH) codes. To design a BCH code over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ of a minimum Hamming distance $\\geq 2t+1$, we form the generator polynomial of the code by taking the product of as many minimal polynomials of powers of $\\alpha$ in a way that $g(x)$ has $2t$ consecutive powers of $\\alpha$ as its roots. Note, $\\alpha$ is some primitive $n$th roots of unity (i.e., an element of multiplicative order $n$) in some extension field $\\mathbb{F}_{q^m}$.

The generator polynomial is a product of such minimal polynomials, but each such minimal polynomial needs to be included only once.  To see whether the minimal polynomial for $a^i$ has already been included in a candidate $g(x)$, simply evaluate $g(a^i)$ to see if $a^i$ is a zero.  Test your implementation by running the following cell.\n",

There is no need to invoke the Forney formula, since there is only one possible error value.  The code locators and parity-check column multipliers can be computed from `a` and `b`."
